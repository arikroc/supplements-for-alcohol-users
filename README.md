**Reviewed and not highly recommended**

- Magnesium
- Emoxypine (http://photos.imageevent.com/diydefense/awakebrain/MexidolPaper.pdf)
- Ashwaghanda (useful dosage likely too large)
- Vitamin C
- Piracetam or Noopept. Beneficial but best to wait until alcohol consumption is close to zero due to the potential for interaction with alcohol. Noopept may be preferred. If noopept "take 10 – 30 mg, once a day" for 30-50 days after stopping alcohol intake.
