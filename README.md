## Supplements for frequent alcohol users and past frequent alcohol users

**General deficiencies induced by alcohol use over time**

- B-complex (for first month after reducing alcohol intake). Benefits: memory, mood enhancement, energy. [1](https://academic.oup.com/alcalc/article/33/4/317/129640)

- Thiamine aka Vitamin B1 (for first month after reducing alcohol intake). Benefits: concentration, energy, muscle functioning. 100mg 3x/day or 300mg once per day. Benfotiamine preferred instead of Thiamine Hcl due to greater absorption. [1](https://rebelem.com/should-you-prescribe-oral-thiamine-for-chronic-alcoholics/), [2](https://academic.oup.com/alcalc/article/31/4/421/145739), [3](https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh27-2/134-142.htm), [4](https://examine.com/supplements/vitamin-b1/)

- Folic acid (for first month after reducing alcohol intake). Benefits: Memory, avoiding sleep disruption, avoiding muscle pain. "When supplementing folate, use up to 400 DFE (400 mcg folate)
When supplementing folic acid, use up to 400 DFE (200 mcg is taken on an empty stomach, 240 mcg if taken with a meal)" [1](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM197109232851301), [2](https://examine.com/supplements/folic-acid/)

- Magnesium. Benefits: Blood pressure, and liver health. Take 200-400mg per day of either magnesium citrate or magnesium glycinate/diglycinate. Avoid other forms of magnesium as they can lead to GI upset. Recommended to order magnesium capsules rather than magnesium tablets, as anecdotal evidence points to the tablets leading to lower rates of patient adherence. [1](https://europepmc.org/abstract/med/1844558), [2](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/01.HYP.19.2.175), [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3544909), [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7847587), [5](https://www.cochrane.org/CD008358/ADDICTN_magnesium-for-the-prevention-or-treatment-of-alcohol-withdrawal-syndrome-in-adults), [6](https://substanceabusepolicy.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1747-597X-3-1), [7](https://examine.com/supplements/magnesium/)

**If you get Insomnia after reducing alcohol intake**

- Melatonin (0.5mg per night, 30 min before bed). Benefits: sleep. [1](https://examine.com/supplements/melatonin/)

**Strengthening your liver**

- NAC "750 – 1,000 mg, once a day." Benefits: Liver health. [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4728225/), [2](https://examine.com/supplements/n-acetylcysteine/)

- Milk Thistle take 150mg "twice a day, for a total daily dose of 300 mg." Benefits: Liver health. Important: Don't take milk thistle before drinking. Take it before sleep if you're sober, otherwise wait until the morning, and if you can't control your timing, avoid consuming milk thistle.

**Reviewed and either not recommended or not particularly worth it**

- Emoxypine (http://photos.imageevent.com/diydefense/awakebrain/MexidolPaper.pdf)
- Ashwaghanda (useful dosage likely too large)
- Vitamin C
- Agmatine (Promising but more research needed. Also, don't take at the same time as alcohol) 250mg once per day. Benefits: reducing cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Don't take Agmatine before drinking. Take it before sleep if you're sober, otherwise wait until the morning. If you can't control your timing, avoid consuming agmatine. [1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166432899001278), [2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009130570700233X), [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10809167)
- Piracetam or Noopept. Beneficial but best to wait until alcohol consumption is close to zero due to the potential for interaction with alcohol. Noopept may be preferred. If noopept "take 10 – 30 mg, once a day" for 30-50 days after stopping alcohol intake.
